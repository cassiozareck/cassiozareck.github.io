Hello world! My name is CÃ¡ssio Ferreira Milc(zareck)! Im a backend software developer. Im 18 years old at the time im writing this. I decided to create this blog to expose my knowledge and experiences, state about current works and what I'm learning right know as well some histories. Also maybe give poor opinions about random subjects, especially tech-related.

I earn a PC very early with maybe the age of 6-7. But my journey with computers maybe started at 11 when I made a computer maintenance course. I always liked math, at primary school I won a honor mention in a math olympiad. But I started programming as 14 years old when I begin to learn python. 

Python was my first language where I really had make a lot of things. I've learned about OOP, used frameworks like pygame to develop games, kivy to develop apps for mobile. I really liked games at this epoch. I also learned how to use Git.

As 15 years old I developed a game from scratch, I've tried to make it using LibGDX and Kotlin but I ended up using C#. This game had more than 1000 lines of code and a really messful codebase Im not gonna lie. But it was a begin. I deployed it on Play Store but unfortunately its not more there as I lost the backup and I couldnt have the last version of it. It was called Magic Pirate.

As a math enthusiast I spend some time at 16 doing low-level graphics with C and OpenGL, learning linear algebra to do matrix operations. I could make a sphere with diffuse lights rotating. Then I switched to Rust because someway low-level, fast and compiled languages was an addiction for me. At this epoch I even made a bootloader from scratch following a book I dont remember the name using assembly because why not. It worked and displayed some VGA texts. In this adventure I ended up learning a lot of fundamental things about PC memory like stack, heap, pointers, allocation...

But I saw early I wouldnt get a job in Rust. It wasn't so liked by companies, then I started to do Flutter development (yes, I never liked to be a frontend developer). I made some simple apps but it was enough. I really was not liking this life! So I found Go lang, the language of backend developers! Simple, compiled, fast, and used in big techs.
At this time I was also pushing myself to use Arch Linux. It was painfull at the begining but my laptop was needing it as it barely had 4gb of RAM. I learn about grep, pipe, echo, std redirection, ps, systemd...
and also begin to learn about network and sockets and I was loving it! I've made few programs in C that could communicate thorough sockets. 

I started learning Go lang and made its Tour at middle of 2021. Then I also migrate to Node and made some small application using Express with MySQL and a bit of unit tests using Jest because I was scared of people saying it was impossible to get your first job with Go. But I've come back very early again and at 2022 I was having some fun with Fiber.

This is who I am. Since 14 I'm a self-taught. I'm still a beginner that has a lot of things to learn in this software world. My aim is to be proficient in backend software development and use my hobby and passion profissionaly. Thanks for reading it have a good day!
