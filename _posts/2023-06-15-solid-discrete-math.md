While I was contributing to Keploy at half of April I thought I was thinking too much on just code. So I decided I needed to add something to my routine. So I choose to learn more fundamental things. I picked the Mathematics for Computer Science course from MIT! What a journey!
Prof. Leighton is one of the best teacher I have ever seen. He explain the subject deeply without keep hours on the same thing. Also, they make you think, you cannot go to another lecture without make exercises and really understand what’s happening. I'll be honest I didnt finish the course. But I really want to finish it another time.

### Technical things about the math course
The course starts teaching discrete math. This is one of the most different thing I have ever seen. You use a kind of philosophic logic to proof things. And with very, very basic axioms such as the Well Ordering Principle (and its brother Induction) you can proof very complex things like some properties of prime numbers. There's a list of these very basic axioms called ZFC set theory and you can proof almost every concept of math using it.

I will be honest, it isnt easy. You have to put your attention on this and have a strong abstractive thinking. Sometimes you’ll just ask yourself but how can I have counterexamples of this if its clearly impossible. Or why this need proof as its obvious. Generally obvious things are pretty hard to proof. The course also proof some of Alan Turing's paper of cryptography and even explain the ENIGMA's gap. 

### Relation to programming and why math is important
We generally don't try to abstract an algorithm. We don’t think in it with mathematical therms. This is bad siince the own act of write algorithms turns itself into an algorithm. When you try to represent a graph in a mathematical way, thinking about it abstractly without programming language barriers you can understand much more whats happening and how to manipulate things. A good algorithm isn’t created thinking in programming but rather on abstract (imaginary) objects we can manipulated. Then we can try to make the computer understand. 

### About SOLID principles
In half of May I also started to read Clean Code as I stopped to contribute. This books is needed if you work with code daily. It is a guide to how save time, money and let a software survive to more time by teaching you how to write good code. But I'll be honest with you that the protagonist of the book is Java. Abstract factory, small functions, these aren't things that is common in Go, looking at any open-source code from a medium project you will see that. 
Also you have to be very carefull about the Dependency Injection principle. I've made few contributions doing it but it was a nighmare if its uncessary. It gets the code very complex and hide the real problem.
