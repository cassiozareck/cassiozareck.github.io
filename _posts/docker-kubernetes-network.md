I've learned that every pod has its own IP, but this IP is only accessible inside the cluster. So, if you want to access a pod from outside, you need to create a service. A service is a virtual IP that will redirect to the pod IP. This is very useful because you can have multiple pods running the same service and the service will redirect to the correct pod. But this is not enough, because you will need to expose this service to the outside world. This is done by creating an ingress. An ingress is a set of rules that will redirect a request to the correct service. For example, if you have a service called backend-service, you can create an ingress that will redirect all requests to /api to this service. This is very useful because you can have multiple services running on the same cluster and redirecting to the correct service.
