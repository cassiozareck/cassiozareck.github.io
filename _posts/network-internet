How the internet works?
I want to start this by explaining how technologies evolved over the time, not how we actually see them, so we can see the problems and why things are the way
they are. I'm not gonna talk about layer 1 since I'm not too used and its just the physical layer with some electrons running over a cable or wireless

### Layer 2 (data link): Local network, the begin

In this layer we don't have an IP, routing rules, OS, NAT... we are in a very primordial and simple environment. We're in the middle of 60s  

Well, lets suppose we have PC 1 and PC 2 and they have no OS. We want to share data between them. Well, lets plug a cable between them and call
this cable ethernet, now we create a function on both devices called send_data(data) and read_data() that'll just send data to this cable and read.
Now we have a conection and can share some bits. But wait, this means we would have to unplug this cable and plug into a PC 3 if we want another 
conection. Oh, that's not so good!

We need something called network! I want to send data to whatever PC or device I want without be pluging and unpluging cables. 
Ok, we need some device that every device will be plugged and send data, and once this happen it will forward request to whatever
device I want. Let's call this device a router. But how does this device will know which device forward a network packet?

We need some identifier for each PC, lets call this identifier a MAC Address (every network card comes with an unique 48-bit MAC address
by default). Every plug on router will be bind to one MAC address. Now we modify a bit our send_data function to send_data(mac, data). 

But it's not just a mess. In this layer we have the Data link protocol that defines every device needs to have its own MAC address, 
which is an 48-bit unique identifier for it. Every network cardboard has an unique MAC by fabric.  

### Layer 3 (IP): Going outside
### Subnet Mask
### NAT and its implications

### TCP and UDP
