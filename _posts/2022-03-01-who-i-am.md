Hello world! My name is Cássio Ferreira Milc(zareck)! Im a backend software developer. Im 18 years old at the time im writing this. I decided to create this blog to expose my knowledge and experiences, state about current works and what I'm learning right know aswell some histories. Also maybe give poor opinions about random subjects especially tech-related.
I earned a PC very early with maybe the age of 6-7. But my journey with computers maybe started at 11 when I made a computer maintenance course. But with programming and with CS itself I would say with 14 when I started with html then I move to python. I always liked math. At primary school I won a honor mention in a math olympiad.

As I said python was my first language where I really had make a lot of things. I've learned about OOP, used frameworks like pygame to develop games, 


- Finished an english course
- Bootcamps with kotlin + how the runtime of it works
- C# game with unity, project that last 3 months with more than 1000 lines of code. Json parse to save the game - Git for code versioning
2021 >
Math
- Combination, permutation, arrangement
- Basics algebra
- A bit about linear algebra: vector, sin and cos and
matrix transformation to make games using OpenGL
Programming
- Resolved more than 100 python exercises
- Created small games and apps using python and kivy. Using
buildozer to build on android
- Learned about OpenGL ES, in books, youtube and artilces, he used it after learned LibGDX in java
- Low level learning: heap, memory, stack
- C and rust (a bit of course) - Linux learnings: why so much distro and whats its purposes - Installed arch linux from scratch and used it for a months - Handling x86 assembly and created a bootloader (todo: book)
