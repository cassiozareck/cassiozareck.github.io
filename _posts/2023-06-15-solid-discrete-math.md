While I was contributing to Keploy at half of April I was thinking too much on just code. I decided I needed to add something to my routine. So I choose to learn more fundamental things. I picked the Mathematics for Computer Science course from MIT! What a journey!

Prof. Leighton is one of the best teacher I have ever saw. He explain the subject deeply without keep hours on the same thing. Also, they make you think, you cannor go to another lecture without make exercises and really understand what’s happening.

### Technical
The course starts teaching discrete math. This is one of the most different thing I have ever seen. You use a kind of philosophy logic to proof things. And with very, very basic axioms such as the Well Ordering Principle you can proof very complex things like some properties of prime numbers.
I will be honest, it isnt easy. You have to put your attention on this and have a strong abstractive thinking. Sometimes you’ll just ask yourself but how can I have counterexamples of this if its clearly impossible. Or why this need proof its obvious.

### Relation to programming
We generally don't try to abstract an algorithm. We don’t think in it with mathematical therms. This is bad because the own act of write algorithms turns itself into an algorithm. When you try to represent a graph in a mathematical way, thinking about it abstractly without programming language barriers you can understand much more whats happening and how to manipulate things. An algorithm isn’t created thinking in programming but rather on abstract (imaginary) objects we can manipulated. Then we can try to make the computer understand
