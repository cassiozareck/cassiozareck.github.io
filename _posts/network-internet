How the internet works?
I want to start this by explaining how technologies evolved over the time, not how we actually see them, so we can see the problems and why things are the way
they are. I'm not gonna talk about layer 1 since I'm not too used and its just the physical layer with some electrons running over a cable or wireless

### Layer 2 (data link): Local network, the begin

In this layer we don't have an IP, routing rules, OS, NAT... we are in a very primordial and simple environment. We're in the middle of 60s  

Well, lets suppose we have PC 1 and PC 2 and they have no OS. We want to share data between them. Well, lets plug a cable between them and call
this cable ethernet, now we create a function on both devices called send_data(data) and read_data() that'll just send data to this cable and read.
Now we have a conection and can share some bits. But wait, this means we would have to unplug this cable and plug into a PC 3 if we want another 
conection. Oh, that's not so good!

We need something called network! I want to send data to whatever PC or device I want without be pluging and unpluging cables. 
Ok, we need some device that every device will be plugged and send data, and once this happen it will forward request to whatever
device I want. Let's call this device a router. But how does this device will know which device forward a network packet?

We need some identifier for each PC, lets call this identifier a MAC Address (every network card comes with an unique 48-bit MAC address
by default). Now we modify a bit our send_data function to send_data(mac, data). Remember, this router is just another device with this
send_data function. But it keeps track of a table with each MAC address bind to one ethernet cable.

Now, jumping on the real world, this process has a lot of details didn't covered and in fact, every device will have an OS, to continue the 
explanation we suppose we're using linux. This send_data we were talking about is implemented in most operating system as interfaces.

### Interfaces: why so subestimated and how linux implement it. 
Network interface is a connection between a device and a network, you can write data in it and it will appear into another point, just like 
our send_data function did when sending data to a router. One device can have more than one interface and you can list them in using `ip addr show`
command. 

Every device on the network including our router will have these interfaces to communicate between each other, and if you look they're bound
with a MAC address (and usually an IP but I'll talk about it later). Your PC probably will have at least 2 interfaces, a loopback (which redirects packets 
to your own machine), and an local network interface which binds your PC with the router and the local network, it's generally called enp3s0 in 
linux-systems. There can also be virtualized interfaces which I'll talk more in a future post about docker network.

Now, interface is a very important concept because your data travels through it, your PC has a table with MAC addresses and interfaces associated

### Subnet Mask
### NAT and its implications

### TCP and UDP
