How the internet works?
I want to start this by explaining how technologies evolved over the time, not how we actually see them, so we can see the problems and why things are the way
they are. I'm not gonna talk about layer 1 since I'm not too used and its just the physical layer with some electrons running over a cable or wireless

### Layer 2 (data link): Local network, the begin
In this layer we don't have an IP, routing rules, NAT... we are in a very primordial and simple environment.  
But it's not just a mess. In this layer we have the Data link protocol that defines every device needs to have its own MAC address, 
which is an 48-bit unique identifier for it. Every network cardboard has an unique MAC by fabric.  

Well, lets suppose we have PC 1 and PC 2. We only have a MAC address for each one but we want to send packets (normal data) from PC 1 to PC 2. 
Well we can use some medium to do that, like the ethernet physical cable (layer 1) and bind it directly to PC 2. But this is not a network, 
it's just a connection. We need someone that can route to several devices by just using a MAC identifier instead of plug direct cables. This 
is why a router exist.


### Layer 3 (IP): Going outside
### Subnet Mask
### NAT and its implications

### TCP and UDP
